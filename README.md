# Force update on Google Sheets from external sources 

This small line of codes allow you to force the update in Google Sheets from external sources, provided that they are not too big.

In order to use this function you will need to go to Tools>>Script, start a new project and past/customize the code according to your needs in the editor. 

If you find that this code curses in Italian, it is because it was written out of frustration when Google's own IMPORDATA() function decided not to work putting in jeopadry most of global COVID trackers. This thing patched the issue for a few hours, then Google fixed the problem.
